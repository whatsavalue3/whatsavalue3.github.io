# Mods

Mods are folders in the `.minecraft/mods` directory.

All definitions are specified in `.ini` files.

There is no directory structure for the definitions, but textures need to be placed in their own `mods/MODNAME/textures/` folder.

A section in the definition file tells the game what type of definition it is.

Definitions can have subsections specified by a `.` in the section name, followed by the subsections name.
